Backend:
- decisionmatrix route, adjust create to add whole decisionmatrix at once
- in server.js, use.cors, allowheaders... what are thos 
- when clicking a case, the whole page content data recieving should be done in one route call (/caseContent), intead of having different for decisiionmatrix and cases so authentication middleware doesn't need to work twice.
- then after this middleware implementation, maybe no need for useeffect checking in every reload 

- /*
        criteriaName
        dataType
        characteristic
        criteriaPoint
*/        

make criterias api calls in this format



Frontend:
- While editing one case, if user clicks to other
- When can't fetch data, in processing page, say couldn't connect to server
